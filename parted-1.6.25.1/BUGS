* boot loader doesn't work

* FAT resizer should be able to change cluster size

* doesn't build on Linux 2.0

* found problem with gettext.  If using included gettext, it must use the
included headers as well.  (This is implemented with auto* stuff now.  It
really should go into the gettext distro, but no-one on the list is
responding)

* wcscasecmp() and wcsncasecmp() in glibc are broken (as of 2.1.2).  Therefore,
commands are case sensitive :-(

* iconv() is broken (fixed in 2.1.3, when it's released).  I'm not sure how
reliable conversion is.  If the translations are 100% correct, there should
be no problems...

* why is UCS4 big-endian on my little-endian machine (glibc 2.1.2)?  This
doesn't match iswxxx, so there's lots of nasty work-arounds...
